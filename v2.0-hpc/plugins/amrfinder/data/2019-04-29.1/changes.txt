Two incorrectly assigned proteins were accidentally released. They are not
AMR proteins and should not have been released. This release simply removes
them and is otherwise unchanged.

Due to a communication error three blaOXA alleles in the AMR database have
been reassigned. Alleles published by Tian, et al. (PMID:30247543) have

Updates in 2018-07-07.1
- Fix in amr_report.cpp to remove extra field from AMRFinder output

Updates in 2018-06-27.1
- Summary:
    - Protein sequences
        - Removed 1 protein sequence
        - Added 290 protein sequences
        - Changed the names of 2 proteins
    - Gene families 
        - cfr was reorganized
    - HMM library
        - 58 HMMs not in the AMR family hierarchy were removed. They were not 
          used for AMR gene identification so this should have no effect on 
          AMRFinder output.
        - The polymyxin_MCR3 HMM was updated
