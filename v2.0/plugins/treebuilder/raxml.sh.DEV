```raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -f a -x 84 -p 42 -N autoMRE -s core.aln -m ASC_GTRCAT -n TEST -T 16 --asc-corr=stamatakis -q part

# if more than 500 isolates add -D flag

# if more than 1000 isolates add -F flag

# `-f a` do rapid bootstrap and search for best ML tree in single run

# -x <seed> tell it to run fast boostrap with seed (required to initiate boostrap, but no guarantee of reprod when running in parallel)

# -p <seed> a random seed for the initial parsimony search to start the ML search

# -N autoMRE --- max number of boostrap replicates --- use an automatic stopping criteria. NOTE: if over 1000 taxa use autoMRE_ING to safe time

# -s alignment file

# -m ASC_GTRCAT --- GTRCAT is an approximation to the GTRGAMMA model --- supposed to run faster. The ASC prefix indicates that some correction for invariable sites should be applied

# --asc-corr --- use the stamatakis ascertainment correction to specify the number of invariable sites for each of A,C,G,T (in that order)

# -q <partition_file> --- this is a partition file, that specifies how the alignemt is partitioned. It should look like this:

#[asc~count_inv_sites_core.txt], ASC_DNA, core=1-<length of alignment>

# the file `count_inv_sites_core.txt` should have one line with space separated counts of invariable sites in the order A,C,G,T:
# 250 300 400 100 ## this says to correct the alignment for 250 constant A, 300 constant C, 400 constant G, and 200 constant T

# -n <suffix_name> --- a suffix for all outputted files (e.g., -n TEST produces `RAxML_bestTree.TEST`)

# -T number of CPUs (only works for PTHREADS versions)

### ADDITIONAL OPTIONS ###

# add -b for traditional bootstrap

# add -d could help with phylogenomic alignments with strong phylogenetic signal

# add -D when >500 taxa to speed things up a bit --- changes the convergence criterion

# add -F When conducting analyses under the CAT model of rate heterogeneity in RAxML, the
# program will in most cases try to evaluate the GAMMA-based score and do some additional
# optimization of the tree under GAMMA in the very end of the search. If you want to avoid
# this because of time and/or memory constraints (GAMMA needs four times more memory
# than CAT) you can use this option.```

So, I think we need slightly different commands depending on the number of isolates.
That should help maintain performance.
Note that files are named by suffix:
```# -n <suffix_name> --- a suffix for all outputted files (e.g., -n TEST produces `RAxML_bestTree.TEST`)```
And, that you need a partition file and a file with number of constant sites.
